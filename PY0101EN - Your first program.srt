Let’s try your first program in Python. A statement or expression is an instruction

1
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:10,360
the computer will run or execute. Perhaps the simplest program you can write

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,490
is a print statement. When you run the print statement, Python will

3
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,520
simply display the value in the parentheses. The value in the parentheses is called the

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,480
argument. If you are using a Jupiter notebook in this

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,640
course, you will see a small rectangle with the statement.

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,780
This is called a cell. If you select this cell with your mouse, then

7
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:37,660
click the run cell button. The statement will execute. The result will be displayed beneath

8
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,249
the cell. We will follow this paradigm in the videos.

9
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:46,891
It’s customary to comment your code. This tells other people what your code does. You

10
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:52,329
simply put a hash symbol proceeding your comment. When you run the code, Python will ignore

11
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:56,149
the comment. A Syntactic error is when Python does not

12
00:00:56,149 --> 00:01:02,609
understand your code. For example, if you spell print "frint", you will get an error

13
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,750
message. A Semantic error is when your logic is wrong.

14
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:13,549
For example, if you enter Python 102 instead of Python 101, you don't get an error message,

15
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:14,850
but your code is wrong.
